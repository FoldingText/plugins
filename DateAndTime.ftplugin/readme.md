Opening paragraph, with an ordered list of autumn leaves I found

1. A big leaf
1. Some small leaves:
    1. Red (nested)
    2. **Orange**
    3. Yellow
1. A medium sized leaf that ~~maybe~~ was pancake shaped

Unordered list of fruits:

- Blueberries
- Apples
  - Macintosh
  - Honey crisp
  - Cortland
- Banana

### Fancy Header Title

Here's what someone said:

> I think blockquotes are cool

Nesting **an *[emphasized link](https://apolloapp.io)* inside strong text**, neato!

And then they mentiond code around 'NSAttributedString' that looked like this code block:

```swift
func yeah() -> NSAttributedString {
// TODO: Write code
}
```

Tables are even supported but (but need more than NSAttributedString' for support :p)
